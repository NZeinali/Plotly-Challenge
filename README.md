# Plot.ly Project - Belly Button Biodiversity

In this project, an interactive dashboard is developed to explore the [Belly Button Biodiversity dataset](http://robdunnlab.com/projects/belly-button-biodiversity/), which catalogs the microbes that colonise human navels.

The dataset reveals that a small handful of microbial species (also called operational taxonomic units, or OTUs, in the study) were present in more than 70% of people, while the rest were relatively rare.

## Task

1. The D3 library is used to read in `samples.json`.

2. A horizontal bar chart is created with a dropdown menu to display the top 10 OTUs found in that individual.

3. A bubble chart is created that displays each sample.

4. The sample metadata is displayed, i.e., an individual's demographic information.

5. Each key-value pair from the metadata JSON object is displayed somewhere on the page.

6. All of the plots are updated any time that a new sample is selected.
